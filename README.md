Adjusting p-values for multiple testing is an important part of analyzing 'omics data. This document was made in order to demonstrate two forms of p-value adjustment on a hypothetical data set of p-values; the Bonferroni and the [Benjamini-Hochberg]( https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x) adjustment. The primary conclusion is that the Benjamini-Hochberg is a more balanced approach for multiple testing correction in the context of 'omics data.
